CREATIVE  CODING CLASS | ALHS | 2018


# GOALS For This Assignment

1. Practicing using Processing 
2. Practice using the ”ellipse” command in Processing 
3. Understand draw order and command ordering 
4. Understand the Processing 2D coordinate systems 
5. Make a picture of  Cross Eyes! 



# REQUIREMENTS 

You must create an image using Processing of Cross Eyes. 

Your ‘sketch’ of the Cross Eyes must: 

• be created using at least 5 ellipses
• be of size 400 by 400 pixels 
• be in color 








# RESOURCES 
Some of this information will help you on your lab. 

Use only the following commands - where you need to figure out what numbers to plug in to get the desired behaviour: 

1. ellipse(?, ?, ? , ?) 
( x, y coordinates, width, height )
2. size(?, ?) 

Note that when drawing a shape you can control some of its properties. 

Commands that are useful are: 

• stroke(r, g, b); ( 0-255, 0-255, 0-255 )
• fill(r, g, b); 
• noStroke();
